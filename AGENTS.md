## Kanban view for Obsidian Bases

Adds a kanban layout to [Obsidian Bases](https://help.obsidian.md/bases) so you can display notes as cards organized in columns.

-   Display notes as cards grouped by a property value
-   Configure which property defines the columns (e.g., status, priority)
-   Customize card title and description properties
-   Click cards to open the corresponding note

## Project overview

-   Target: Obsidian Community Plugin (TypeScript → bundled JavaScript).
-   Entry point: `main.ts` compiled to `main.js` and loaded by Obsidian.
-   Required release artifacts: `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and optional `styles.css`.

## Environment & tooling

-   Node.js: use current LTS (Node 18+ recommended).
-   **Package manager: npm** (required for this sample - `package.json` defines npm scripts and dependencies).
-   **Bundler: esbuild** (required for this sample - `esbuild.config.mjs` and build scripts depend on it). Alternative bundlers like Rollup or webpack are acceptable for other projects if they bundle all external dependencies into `main.js`.
-   Types: `obsidian` type definitions.

**Note**: This sample project has specific technical dependencies on npm and esbuild. If you're creating a plugin from scratch, you can choose different tools, but you'll need to replace the build configuration accordingly.

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Dev (watch)

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Linting

-   To use eslint install eslint from terminal: `npm install -g eslint`
-   To use eslint to analyze this project use this command: `eslint main.ts`
-   eslint will then create a report with suggestions for code improvement by file and line number.
-   If your source code is in a folder, such as `src`, you can use eslint with this command to analyze all files in that folder: `eslint ./src/`

## File & folder conventions

-   **Organize code into multiple files**: Split functionality across separate modules rather than putting everything in `main.ts`.
-   Source lives in `src/`. Keep `main.ts` small and focused on plugin lifecycle (loading, unloading, registering commands).
-   **Example file structure**:
    ```
    src/
      main.ts           # Plugin entry point, lifecycle management
      settings.ts       # Settings interface and defaults
      kanban-view.ts    # BasesView implementation for kanban
      commands/         # Command implementations
        command1.ts
        command2.ts
      ui/              # UI components, modals, views
        modal.ts
        view.ts
      utils/           # Utility functions, helpers
        helpers.ts
        constants.ts
      types.ts         # TypeScript interfaces and types
    ```
-   **Do not commit build artifacts**: Never commit `node_modules/`, `main.js`, or other generated files to version control.
-   Keep the plugin small. Avoid large dependencies. Prefer browser-compatible packages.
-   Generated output should be placed at the plugin root or `dist/` depending on your build setup. Release artifacts must end up at the top level of the plugin folder in the vault (`main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`).

## Manifest rules (`manifest.json`)

-   Must include (non-exhaustive):
    -   `id` (plugin ID; for local dev it should match the folder name)
    -   `name`
    -   `version` (Semantic Versioning `x.y.z`)
    -   `minAppVersion`
    -   `description`
    -   `isDesktopOnly` (boolean)
    -   Optional: `author`, `authorUrl`, `fundingUrl` (string or map)
-   Never change `id` after release. Treat it as stable API.
-   Keep `minAppVersion` accurate when using newer APIs.
-   Canonical requirements are coded here: https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/blob/master/.github/workflows/validate-plugin-entry.yml

## Testing

-   Manual install for testing: copy `main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css` (if any) to:
    ```
    <Vault>/.obsidian/plugins/<plugin-id>/
    ```
-   Reload Obsidian and enable the plugin in **Settings → Community plugins**.

## Commands & settings

-   Any user-facing commands should be added via `this.addCommand(...)`.
-   If the plugin has configuration, provide a settings tab and sensible defaults.
-   Persist settings using `this.loadData()` / `this.saveData()`.
-   Use stable command IDs; avoid renaming once released.
-   **No default hotkeys**: Avoid setting default hotkeys for commands. Let users configure their own.
-   **Use appropriate callback type**:
    -   `callback`: Simple commands that always work
    -   `checkCallback`: Commands that may be disabled based on context
    -   `editorCallback`: Commands that operate on the editor

## Workspace, editor, and vault

-   **Avoid workspace.activeLeaf**: This is deprecated. Use `getActiveViewOfType()` instead:

```ts
const view = this.app.workspace.getActiveViewOfType(MarkdownView);
if (view) {
	// work with view
}
```

-   **Use Editor for active notes**: When editing the currently open note, use the `Editor` interface, not `Vault.modify()`.
-   **Use Vault.process() for closed notes**: For notes that aren't open, use `Vault.process()` instead of `Vault.modify()`.
-   **Use processFrontMatter()**: For modifying frontmatter, use `FileManager.processFrontMatter()` instead of parsing YAML manually.
-   **Use direct file lookups**: Use `Vault.getFileByPath()`, `Vault.getFolderByPath()`, or `Vault.getAbstractFileByPath()` instead of iterating all files.
-   **Normalize paths**: Always use `normalizePath()` for user-defined paths to handle cross-platform path separators.
-   **Never detach leaves in onunload()**: This causes issues when Obsidian restarts.

## Versioning & releases

-   Bump `version` in `manifest.json` (SemVer) and update `versions.json` to map plugin version → minimum app version.
-   Create a GitHub release whose tag exactly matches `manifest.json`'s `version`. Do not use a leading `v`.
-   Attach `manifest.json`, `main.js`, and `styles.css` (if present) to the release as individual assets.
-   After the initial release, follow the process to add/update your plugin in the community catalog as required.

## Security, privacy, and compliance

Follow Obsidian's **Developer Policies** and **Plugin Guidelines**. In particular:

-   Default to local/offline operation. Only make network requests when essential to the feature.
-   No hidden telemetry. If you collect optional analytics or call third-party services, require explicit opt-in and document clearly in `README.md` and in settings.
-   Never execute remote code, fetch and eval scripts, or auto-update plugin code outside of normal releases.
-   Minimize scope: read/write only what's necessary inside the vault. Do not access files outside the vault.
-   Clearly disclose any external services used, data sent, and risks.
-   Respect user privacy. Do not collect vault contents, filenames, or personal information unless absolutely necessary and explicitly consented.
-   Avoid deceptive patterns, ads, or spammy notifications.
-   Register and clean up all DOM, app, and interval listeners using the provided `register*` helpers so the plugin unloads safely.
-   **Avoid innerHTML**: Never use `innerHTML`, `outerHTML`, or `insertAdjacentHTML`. Use `createEl()`, `createDiv()`, `createSpan()` instead.

## UX & copy guidelines (for UI text, commands, settings)

-   Prefer sentence case for headings, buttons, and titles.
-   Use clear, action-oriented imperatives in step-by-step copy.
-   Use **bold** to indicate literal UI labels. Prefer "select" for interactions.
-   Use arrow notation for navigation: **Settings → Community plugins**.
-   Keep in-app strings short, consistent, and free of jargon.
-   **Use setHeading()**: For settings headings, use `Setting.setHeading()` instead of raw `<h1>`, `<h2>` elements.
-   **Avoid "settings" in headings**: Don't include the word "settings" in settings section headings.
-   **Minimal section headings**: Only use section headings if you have multiple distinct settings groups.

## Performance

-   Keep startup light. Defer heavy work until needed.
-   Avoid long-running tasks during `onload`; use lazy initialization.
-   Batch disk access and avoid excessive vault scans.
-   Debounce/throttle expensive operations in response to file system events.

## Coding conventions

-   TypeScript with `"strict": true` preferred.
-   **Keep `main.ts` minimal**: Focus only on plugin lifecycle (onload, onunload, addCommand calls). Delegate all feature logic to separate modules.
-   **Split large files**: If any file exceeds ~200-300 lines, consider breaking it into smaller, focused modules.
-   **Use clear module boundaries**: Each file should have a single, well-defined responsibility.
-   Bundle everything into `main.js` (no unbundled runtime deps).
-   Avoid Node/Electron APIs if you want mobile compatibility; set `isDesktopOnly` accordingly.
-   Prefer `async/await` over promise chains; handle errors gracefully.
-   **Avoid global app**: Never use `app` or `window.app`. Always use `this.app` from the plugin instance.
-   **Avoid unnecessary logging**: Remove or disable `console.log()` calls in production.
-   **Use let/const**: Never use `var`.

## Mobile

-   Where feasible, test on iOS and Android.
-   Don't assume desktop-only behavior unless `isDesktopOnly` is `true`.
-   Avoid large in-memory structures; be mindful of memory and storage constraints.
-   **Node.js and Electron APIs unavailable**: These APIs don't work on mobile. Any calls can crash your plugin on iOS/Android.
-   **Lookbehind regex limitation**: Lookbehind in regular expressions only works on iOS 16.4+. Provide fallbacks for older versions.
-   **Check platform when needed**: Use `Platform.isMobile`, `Platform.isDesktop`, etc. for platform-specific code.

## Agent do/don't

**Do**

-   Add commands with stable IDs (don't rename once released).
-   Provide defaults and validation in settings.
-   Write idempotent code paths so reload/unload doesn't leak listeners or intervals.
-   Use `this.register*` helpers for everything that needs cleanup.

**Don't**

-   Introduce network calls without an obvious user-facing reason and documentation.
-   Ship features that require cloud services without clear disclosure and explicit opt-in.
-   Store or transmit vault contents unless essential and consented.

## Bases Views (for this plugin)

When implementing `BasesView`:

-   Extend `BasesView` class from 'obsidian'
-   Implement `onDataUpdated()` to react to data changes
-   Implement static `getViewOptions()` to expose configuration options
-   Use `this.data` to access query results
-   Use `this.config` to access view configuration
-   Register the view with `this.registerBasesView()` in the plugin

## Common tasks

### Organize code across multiple files

**main.ts** (minimal, lifecycle only):

```ts
import { Plugin } from "obsidian";
import { MySettings, DEFAULT_SETTINGS } from "./settings";
import { registerCommands } from "./commands";

export default class MyPlugin extends Plugin {
	settings: MySettings;

	async onload() {
		this.settings = Object.assign(
			{},
			DEFAULT_SETTINGS,
			await this.loadData()
		);
		registerCommands(this);
	}
}
```

**settings.ts**:

```ts
export interface MySettings {
	enabled: boolean;
	apiKey: string;
}

export const DEFAULT_SETTINGS: MySettings = {
	enabled: true,
	apiKey: "",
};
```

**commands/index.ts**:

```ts
import { Plugin } from "obsidian";
import { doSomething } from "./my-command";

export function registerCommands(plugin: Plugin) {
	plugin.addCommand({
		id: "do-something",
		name: "Do something",
		callback: () => doSomething(plugin),
	});
}
```

### Add a command

```ts
this.addCommand({
	id: "your-command-id",
	name: "Do the thing",
	callback: () => this.doTheThing(),
});
```

### Persist settings

```ts
interface MySettings { enabled: boolean }
const DEFAULT_SETTINGS: MySettings = { enabled: true };

async onload() {
  this.settings = Object.assign({}, DEFAULT_SETTINGS, await this.loadData());
  await this.saveData(this.settings);
}
```

### Register listeners safely

```ts
this.registerEvent(
	this.app.workspace.on("file-open", (f) => {
		/* ... */
	})
);
this.registerDomEvent(window, "resize", () => {
	/* ... */
});
this.registerInterval(
	window.setInterval(() => {
		/* ... */
	}, 1000)
);
```

## Troubleshooting

-   Plugin doesn't load after build: ensure `main.js` and `manifest.json` are at the top level of the plugin folder under `<Vault>/.obsidian/plugins/<plugin-id>/`.
-   Build issues: if `main.js` is missing, run `npm run build` or `npm run dev` to compile your TypeScript source code.
-   Commands not appearing: verify `addCommand` runs after `onload` and IDs are unique.
-   Settings not persisting: ensure `loadData`/`saveData` are awaited and you re-render the UI after changes.
-   Mobile-only issues: confirm you're not using desktop-only APIs; check `isDesktopOnly` and adjust.
